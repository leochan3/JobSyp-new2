**Role Overview:**



At Wayfair, we believe everyone deserves a home they love—and as a **Design Specialist**, you’ll help make that happen. You'll be more than a salesperson; you’ll be a trusted design partner, guiding customers through everything from furniture selections to full\-room transformations. Using your interior design expertise, trend awareness, and flair for customer service, you’ll help bring their vision to life—whether in\-store, virtually, or in their home.



This role blends creativity and strategy, giving you the tools to inspire and the autonomy to deliver results. From room layouts to fabric swatches, your design solutions will reflect each customer’s unique style, budget, and needs. We’re not just a store—we’re a community of creators, doers, and dreamers. At Wayfair, you’ll join a team that cheers each other on, celebrates wins big and small, and knows that building beautiful homes should also be fun.



Ready to help customers fall in love with their homes—and your career? **Let’s make it happen.**


**What Does A Retail Design Specialist Do?**


* **Be the Customer’s Trusted Advisor:** Greet, listen, and learn. You’ll lead design consultations that feel more like conversations, getting to know your customer’s style, needs, and how they really live. Whether it’s a growing family, a new pet, or a dream remodel, you’ll help it all come together beautifully.
* **Turn Vision Into Reality:** Create stunning, functional spaces using your design expertise—think color theory, spatial planning , textiles, and trend\-savvy picks. You'll walk customers through fabric swatches, finishes, and product choices with confidence and clarity.
* ️ **Inspire with Tech \+ Tools:** Build out 2D/3D room views, mood boards, and persuasive presentations using our design software. (Bonus points if you’ve dabbled in tools like SketchUp, DesignFiles, Floorplanner, Icovia, or a similar tool!)
* **Always Be Designing (and Selling):** Every interaction is a chance to build trust and drive results. You’ll grow sales by turning design dreams into shoppable plans—and guiding customers every step of the way.
* **Multitask with Purpose:** Balance design appointments, sales floor chats, team collabs—you’ll handle it all with a positive attitude and a flexible mindset.
* **Be a Team Player:** Pitch in on floor sets, help with replenishment, and share your best design hacks with the team. We grow together here.
* **Drive Sales with Style:** Every interaction is an opportunity to build trust, grow your pipeline, and close the loop on beautiful, functional spaces. You’ll actively seek out leads and help customers take the next step.


**You’ll Thrive in this Role if You Have:**


* ️ **Sales Chops:** 2\+ years of sales experience, ideally with higher price\-point products or in a design\-related retail environment.
* ️ **Design Know\-How:** At least 1 year of experience in interior, architectural, or graphic design—plus a solid grasp of spatial planning, color theory, and style trends.

* ️ **Great People Skills:** You're a strong communicator with the confidence to guide, advise, and build trust with customers from all walks of life.
* + **A Hustle Mindset:** You thrive in a fast\-paced setting and know how to prioritize like a pro—whether you're juggling back\-to\-back appointments or jumping in to help on the floor.
* **A Design\-Driven Background:** A bachelor’s degree or equivalent design\-related education is a plus, but not a deal\-breaker. Passion and skill go a long way!

Using your interior design expertise, trend awareness, and flair for customer service, you’ll help bring their vision to life—whether in\-store, virtually, or in their home.



This role blends creativity and strategy, giving you the tools to inspire and the autonomy to deliver results.

* **A Design\-Driven Background:** A bachelor’s degree or equivalent design\-related education is a plus, but not a deal\-breaker. Passion and skill go a long way!
