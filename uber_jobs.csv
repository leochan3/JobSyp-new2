The mission of the Surge team is to maintain overall marketplace reliability by balancing supply/demand in real\-time through dynamic pricing. We build scalable real\-time systems to understand the state of the market, forecast future demand, make predictions using ML models, solve network optimization programs, and eventually make pricing decisions for each rider session.
  

  

Surge plays a critical role in service of Uber's mission to make transport accessible. We generate billions of dollars in annual gross bookings for the company by optimizing network efficiency and make a significant contribution to driver earnings. In addition to pricing, the signals we generate are some of the most important features used in practically every optimization/ML system across Uber. Although we are a backend team, what we do has an outsized impact on our riders because prices and reliability are two of the most important elements of customer experience.

**About the Role**  

  

Have you ever ordered a car service on Uber, and when the ride arrives, wondered how it got to you so fast? Ever ordered food on UberEats and wondered where the driver was before receiving your order and how long it took to get to the restaurant or if your order was ready when the courier arrived? Ever wondered why your grocery delivery from Uber always has the best apple picked? If so, Uber is for you. In our Sciences division, we strive to make magic within Uber's marketplace. This requires judgment to make difficult trade\-offs, blending algorithms with human resourcefulness, and the ability to build simplicity from complexity. When we get the balance right for everyone, Uber magic happens. We build systems to peer into the future to craft the most cost\-efficient marketplace for matching supply and demand. We are passionate about using innovative economics, machine learning, and scalable distributed software that automates and optimizes every aspect of this intricate dance between participants of the marketplace.

* Architect and guide the implementation of real\-time defenses against scraping and data abuse, working on adversarial machine learning and bot detection solutions to protect Uber's data and platform integrity at scale.
* Drive critical cross\-functional initiatives by partnering with data science, security, product, and engineering teams to align technical solutions with business priorities and long\-term strategy.

* Understanding of feature engineering and dimensionality reduction.
* Familiarity with machine Learning software such as Tensorflow/Pytorch, Caffe, Scikit\-Learn, or Spark MLLib

We're tackling some of the hardest, most high\-impact problems in the grocery and ML space\-at Uber scale. The team is rapidly growing with high impact and visibility from the top. We are responsible for developing state of the art technology to optimize the pricing and incentives strategy in our platform that directly drives efficiencies and effectiveness across user interactions with Uber.

We're looking for an experienced and visionary **Senior Machine Learning Manager** to lead the ML strategy and execution for Uber Grocery's **Catalog team** . This team powers **every single consumer\-facing experience in the Uber Eats app** \-from what users see when they open the app to the products they choose at checkout.
  

  

As the ML leader on this team, you'll be responsible for building and scaling a diverse range of AI/ML systems that make sense of vast, complex, and ever\-evolving grocery data. This includes everything from **deep semantic understanding of catalog items** to **large\-scale inventory forecasting** and **novel computer vision applications** that integrate directly with courier workflows. You'll guide a team of talented ML engineers and collaborate cross\-functionally with product, design, operations, and platform teams to shape the future of grocery shopping on Uber Eats.
  

  

**About the Team:**  

  

The **Catalog team** sits at the heart of Uber Grocery. If you've ever searched for an item, scrolled through a carousel, or tapped on a product to see more info\- **that's our work in action** . We provide the foundational intelligence that powers the Uber Eats grocery experience.
  

  

From an ML perspective, our scope is vast and challenging:
* **Catalog Understanding \& Enrichment** : We build models that determine what each item really is\-its brand, flavor, color, and what kinds of customers might prefer it. Our enrichment models help transform raw merchant data into a delightful user experience.
* **Product Relationships** : Our systems learn how products relate to one another\-what's a substitute, what's often bought together, and what combinations drive better outcomes for both customers and merchants.
* **Inventory Forecasting** : Grocery inventory is volatile and high\-stakes. Our team builds and maintains large\-scale ML forecasting systems to predict availability and reduce substitutions\-at a scale few companies ever reach.
* **Computer Vision for Real\-World Mapping** : We're pushing the frontier of real\-time store mapping using computer vision. Couriers use their phone cameras to help digitize physical grocery stores, feeding our inventory systems with real\-time data.

We're tackling some of the hardest, most high\-impact problems in the grocery and ML space\-at Uber scale. The team is rapidly growing with high impact and visibility from the top. We are responsible for developing state of the art technology to optimize the pricing and incentives strategy in our platform that directly drives efficiencies and effectiveness across user interactions with Uber.

As a designer on the Rider team, you will create intuitive, inclusive, and delightful experiences for people around the world. Your work will span interaction, systems, and service design, grounded in a human\-centered process that balances user needs, business goals, and technical possibilities.

**Scope:** Work on projects of all sizes, from problems that are well\-known to those more complex and conceptual, while leading a roadmap in your product area
  

  

**Process:** Build a deep understanding of the users you are designing for through data and research, lead the end\-to\-end design process, solicit and incorporate feedback from experts, translate your designs to build with engineers, and work flexibly with a variety of teams. Design at all levels of fidelity and practice good judgment on making tradeoffs.
  

  

**Craft:** Deliver designs that are innovative and elegant, buildable and scalable, and are thoroughly documented. Have a strong understanding of business, data, and engineering requirements, and create experiences that deliver customer value.
  

  

**Efficiency:** Prioritize and manage your time efficiently, operate with high autonomy, and easily adapt to challenges.
  

  

**Communication:** Communicate with clarity and persuasiveness, and effectively present your work and rationale to all the relevant stakeholders. Proactively communicate with your team and manager, facilitate design sessions, and collaborate with other designers. Maintain honest and trusting relationships with your team.
  

  

**Basic Qualifications*** 5\+ years of product design experience
* Experience building products for mobile apps, tablets, and web interfaces

**Preferred Qualifications*** A degree in HCI, Graphic Design, or a related field
* Proficiency with Figma or similar tools and prototyping methods
* A portfolio showing your high\-quality, thoughtful UI and UX work
