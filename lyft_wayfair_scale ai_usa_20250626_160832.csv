Using your interior design expertise, trend awareness, and flair for customer service, you’ll help bring their vision to life—whether in\-store, virtually, or in their home.



This role blends creativity and strategy, giving you the tools to inspire and the autonomy to deliver results.

* **A Design\-Driven Background:** A bachelor’s degree or equivalent design\-related education is a plus, but not a deal\-breaker. Passion and skill go a long way!

Wayfair believes everyone deserves a home they love, and that furnishing your home should be a source of fun, not anxiety. Our Product team plays a crucial role in making this vision a reality for millions of people around the world.

With millions of impressions each month on pages like My Account and Track Package, we have immense potential to create better experiences that lead to both repeat revenue and cost savings.

You will drive business outcomes through strong stakeholder engagement and creative and testable solutions for metric improvements, while simultaneously supporting investments in technology transformation initiatives that simplify and modernize our code base.

You will own your roadmap, measure performance, keep your pulse on the customer, anticipate bottlenecks, make tradeoffs, and take acceptable risks to maximize the benefit for our customers and business
* Build strong relationships throughout the organization, ensuring transparency across our roadmaps and surfacing opportunities to improve our collective velocity, consistency and/or quality
* Autonomously establish and maintain collaborative, trusting relationships with stakeholders and manage expectations
* Partner closely with Engineering and Analytics teams to execute against your roadmap and continually improve team velocity
* Improve our product in ways that matter most to our users and have the biggest impact on our KPIs by using quantitative and qualitative data
* Work with your product peers and leadership to contribute to improving our product craft and processes throughout the extended Data Engineering team

  


**What You’ll Need**


* 5\+ years of product management experience, preferably in customer\-facing roles
* Strong technical background with a passion for breaking down challenging problems
* Excellent analytical skills with demonstrated experience turning data into actionable insights (preference for working with Google Cloud Platform products such as Google BigQuery, Looker or similar products experiences from another platform)
* Proficient with SQL and writing complex but efficient queries
* Excellent communication and stakeholder management skills at the senior leadership level, as well as with cross\-functional teams, especially ability to partner with engineering teams and explain technical terminology to non\-technical audiences
* Deep understanding of business strategy and metrics
* BA with strong academic record (strong preference for technical/engineering backgrounds)
* Positive, people\-oriented, and energetic attitude

* Build and maintain scalable ML services to automatically assess and generate high\-quality training and evaluation data
* Research and apply state\-of\-the\-art techniques in LLM training, post\-training alignment (e.g., instruction tuning, RLHF), and tool\-augmented reasoning
* Collaborate with research scientists, engineers, and product teams to integrate your work into production services used by top AI developers
  


**Ideally you'd have:**


* 3\+ years of experience designing, training, and deploying ML models in production environments
* Strong background in NLP, LLMs, and deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX
* Experience building microservices and deploying ML pipelines in cloud environments (e.g., AWS or GCP)
* Practical knowledge of LLM fine\-tuning and evaluation for tasks like factuality, instruction adherence, and chain\-of\-thought reasoning
* Strong programming skills (e.g., Python) and a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures
* Strong communication skills and experience working cross\-functionally
  


**Nice to haves:**


* Experience with post\-training LLM techniques (instruction tuning, RLHF, tool use, or agent\-based reasoning)
* Familiarity with data evaluation pipelines, dataset curation, or scalable annotation workflows
* Background in multimodal ML or model evaluation across domains such as code or long\-context generation
