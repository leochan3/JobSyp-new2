## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1: Install from GitHub (Recommended)
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/leochan3/JobSyp-new2.git
```

### Option 2: Install locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leochan3/JobSyp-new2.git
cd JobSyp-new2
pip install -e .
```

## 📖 Usage

### Import the Enhanced Version
```python
# Import the enhanced JobSpy (different from original jobspy)
from jobspy_enhanced import scrape_jobs
import pandas as pd

# Basic usage with company-specific filtering
jobs = scrape_jobs(
    site_name=['indeed'],
    indeed_company_id='Amazon',  # Company-specific filter
    location='Seattle, WA',
    results_wanted=1000,
    hours_old=24,  # Optional: time filter
    verbose=1
)

# Export to CSV
jobs.to_csv('amazon_jobs.csv', index=False)
print(f"Found {len(jobs)} Amazon jobs")
```

### Key Features
- **Company-Specific Filtering**: Use `indeed_company_id` parameter to scrape only jobs from a specific company
- **100% Accuracy**: Unlike the original JobSpy, this version filters for only the specified company
- **Time Filtering**: Use `hours_old` parameter to filter by posting date
- **Multiple Job Boards**: Supports Indeed with company filtering

### Example Use Cases

#### Amazon Jobs in Seattle (24 hours)
```python
jobs = scrape_jobs(
    site_name=['indeed'],
    indeed_company_id='Amazon',
    location='Seattle, WA',
    results_wanted=1000,
    hours_old=24,
    verbose=1
)
```

#### Walmart Jobs in Bentonville (all time)
```python
jobs = scrape_jobs(
    site_name=['indeed'],
    indeed_company_id='Walmart',
    location='Bentonville, AR',
    results_wanted=1000,
    verbose=1
)
```

#### Uber Jobs Nationwide (all time)
```python
jobs = scrape_jobs(
    site_name=['indeed'],
    indeed_company_id='Uber',
    location='United States',
    results_wanted=1000,
    verbose=1
)
```

## 🔧 Parameters

### Required Parameters:
- **`site_name`**: `['indeed']` (currently supports Indeed with company filtering)
- **`indeed_company_id`**: Company name (e.g., 'Amazon', 'Walmart', 'Lyft', 'Uber')
- **`location`**: City and state (e.g., 'Seattle, WA', 'Bentonville, AR', 'United States')

### Optional Parameters:
- **`results_wanted`**: Number of jobs to scrape (default: 1000)
- **`hours_old`**: Time filter in hours (e.g., 24, 48, 168 for 1 week)
- **`verbose`**: Show progress (0=quiet, 1=progress)

## 📊 Data Analysis
```python
# View results
print(f"Total jobs: {len(jobs)}")
print(f"Company jobs: {len(jobs[jobs['company'].str.contains('Amazon', case=False)])}")

# Location breakdown
print(jobs['location'].value_counts())

# Job types
print(jobs['job_type'].value_counts())

# Sample job titles
print(jobs['title'].head(10))
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes:
1. **No Conflicts**: This package uses `jobspy_enhanced` import, so it won't conflict with the original `jobspy`
2. **Company ID**: Use the exact company name as it appears on Indeed
3. **Location**: Use standard city/state format
4. **Time Filter**: `hours_old=24` for last 24 hours, omit for all time
5. **Results**: Limited to 1000 jobs maximum
6. **Accuracy**: 100% company-specific filtering

## 🆚 Differences from Original JobSpy

| Feature | Original JobSpy | Enhanced JobSpy |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Import | `from jobspy import scrape_jobs` | `from jobspy_enhanced import scrape_jobs` |

| Accuracy | ~60-80% | 100% |
| Time Filtering | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (`hours_old`) |

    results_wanted=20,
    hours_old=72,
    country_indeed='USA',
    
    # linkedin_fetch_description=True # gets more info such as description, direct job url (slower)

## Supported Countries for Job Searching

### **LinkedIn**

LinkedIn searches globally & uses only the `location` parameter. 

### **ZipRecruiter**

ZipRecruiter searches for jobs in **US/Canada** & uses only the `location` parameter.

### **Indeed / Glassdoor**

Indeed & Glassdoor supports most countries, but the `country_indeed` parameter is required. Additionally, use the `location`
parameter to narrow down the location, e.g. city & state if necessary. 

You can specify the following countries when searching on Indeed (use the exact name, * indicates support for Glassdoor):

|                      |              |            |                |
|----------------------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| Argentina            | Australia*   | Austria*   | Bahrain        |
| Belgium*             | Brazil*      | Canada*    | Chile          |
| China                | Colombia     | Costa Rica | Czech Republic |
| Denmark              | Ecuador      | Egypt      | Finland        |
| France*              | Germany*     | Greece     | Hong Kong*     |
| Hungary              | India*       | Indonesia  | Ireland*       |

| Netherlands*         | New Zealand* | Nigeria    | Norway         |
| Oman                 | Pakistan     | Panama     | Peru           |
| Philippines          | Poland       | Portugal   | Qatar          |

| Venezuela            | Vietnam*     |            |                |

### **Bayt**

Bayt only uses the search_term parameter currently and searches internationally



## Notes
* Indeed is the best scraper currently with no rate limiting.  
* All the job board endpoints are capped at around 1000 jobs on a given search.  
* LinkedIn is the most restrictive and usually rate limits around the 10th page with one ip. Proxies are a must basically.

## Frequently Asked Questions

---
**Q: Why is Indeed giving unrelated roles?**  
**A:** Indeed searches the description too.

- use - to remove words
- "" for exact match

Example of a good Indeed query

```py
search_term='"engineering intern" software summer (java OR python OR c++) 2025 -tax -marketing'
```

This searches the description/title and must include software, summer, 2025, one of the languages, engineering intern exactly, no tax, no marketing.

---

**Q: No results when using "google"?**  
**A:** You have to use super specific syntax. Search for google jobs on your browser and then whatever pops up in the google jobs search box after applying some filters is what you need to copy & paste into the google_search_term. 

---

**Q: Received a response code 429?**  
**A:** This indicates that you have been blocked by the job board site for sending too many requests. All of the job board sites are aggressive with blocking. We recommend:

- Wait some time between scrapes (site-dependent).
- Try using the proxies param to change your IP address.
