Amazon Devices is the team behind the best\-selling Amazon Echo \& Alexa devices, Kindle e\-reader, Fire tablet, Fire TV, and Dash Button product lines. Devices hosts a highly diverse and innovative 24k\+ employee base in software and hardware engineering, supply chain and manufacturing, to product and program management distributed across 30\+ countries.
  

  

The Principal, Talent Management Business Partner (TMBP) role will build a holistic, integrated talent strategy for certain business leaders within the Amazon Devices business, alongside their TMBP peers, while rolling up their sleeves to deliver and own end\-to\-end organization wide org effectiveness solutions. The Principal will conduct organization level analyses to uncover meaningful insights on critical talent issues. They will partner closely with PXT (HR) leaders and business leaders to drive organizational design efforts, and build/manage talent experiences and mechanisms, while also connecting intentionally with other Devices PXT COEs, Amazon Global Talent Management teams, and other Talent Management experts to continuously scale solutions, learn from other ongoing or new efforts, and strengthen skillsets and expertise.
  

  

This is a great opportunity for a strong systems thinker and builder to directly impact mechanisms we use to assess, grow, retain, and place Amazon Devices talent. This position provides invaluable exposure to broad HR strategic efforts where you can strongly influence. As a senior member of talent management, this role provides ample opportunity to design and innovate solutions for, and regularly communicate with, HR and business leadership.
  

  

The ideal candidate must be self\-driven, possess a high degree of ownership and have strong people and business acumen, excellent business writing and influencing skills, refined planning/project management skills, and should thrive working in a fast\-paced and ambiguous environment. This role requires dealing with a high level of autonomy and feeling comfortable organizing and operating in a space with little direction for solving hard, complex talent and business problems. There is no opportunity in this role to outsource work to external consultants, so candidates must have strong ownership, grit, and drive for results.
  

  

The successful candidate will have a demonstrated track record of:
  

  

* Knowing Your Customers. Understand their priorities, what they are saying, and more importantly, what they aren’t. Deliver and drive value for them.
* Innovation. Appreciate what exists, identify why it works. Then rebuild it or build something different that derives even MORE value and a better customer experience.
* Judgment. Take different perspectives and business needs, develop a solution that works, move the ball forward. Be able to support your opinions with sound reasoning grounded in the business.
* Systems Thinker. Understand all the connections and integration points through the entire talent management lifecycle.
* Thinking Big. How do we build it bigger, better, faster? What aren’t we thinking of?
* Research driven. We form hypotheses about the best talent management techniques and then set out to prove or disprove them with experiments and careful data collection.
* Prioritization. There will be a constant flow of work, both tactical and strategic. Determine what gets done first and why, while managing a plan for what to do with everything else.
* Building relationships. Partner with Devices HR COE teams, HR Business Partners, Business Leaders, and corporate COE teams. Share best practices, partner on solutions, and move the organizations forward together.
* Consulting. Utilize past experience, deep knowledge of processes and policies, and knowing what’s going on across our organization to create custom solutions and localize as needed.
* Communicating. Share your ideas, listen to others, follow\-up, and follow\-up again. Clarify that your solution will solve the business problem, and use the language of the business and avoid “consultant speak”.
* Resourcefulness. If you don’t know it, that’s ok. But you should know where to go for the answer or how to find out.
* Bias for Action and dealing with ambiguity. Sometimes it is not clear how we are going to get there. Can you help carve a path? How fast can you do it? What are the tradeoffs? Take risks and be willing to try new things, fail fast and iterate.

  

Key job responsibilities  

* Design the overall talent review strategy in partnership with the PXT (HR) and business leader, including promotions, succession planning, talent development, long\-term talent planning, and organizational reviews; design a holistic system for talent programs that deliver meaningful insight on critical talent issues and builds a strong and diverse senior leader bench and pipeline; this includes clear inputs, simplified processes, and actionable outcomes, feeding one talent process to another throughout the year.
* Talent Management, Assessment, and Review: Build innovative, scalable talent assessment and review mechanisms to grow and retain critical senior leader talent, including proposals for new programs like rotating senior leader talent in to hard\-to\-fill and/or critical roles.
* Recognize where there may be gaps between global and business\-specific needs. Creatively find solutions to fill these gaps, where appropriate. Influence the D\&S, AADA, and global talent teams by advocating for change and sharing best practices.
* Partner with our Analytics team to automate talent reporting and building innovative tools to uncover talent insights and drive strategic talent discussions.
* Benchmark best practices for strategic talent management experiences, and work backward from the business problem and employee experience to implement solutions that make sense.
* Program manage and own select talent management programs built for the Amazon Devices organization, or Amazon\-wide.
* Measure and assess the impact of tools and resources introduced to the organization. Continually evaluate solutions for quality, business impact, scalability and sustainability. Conduct post launch evaluations to understand successes and improvement opportunities while establishing methods for sustained adoption.

* Strong background in building an overall talent strategy in a highly ambiguous, flexible environment.

Amazon Devices is the team behind the best\-selling Amazon Echo \& Alexa devices, Kindle e\-reader, Fire tablet, Fire TV, and Dash Button product lines. Devices hosts a highly diverse and innovative 24k\+ employee base in software and hardware engineering, supply chain and manufacturing, to product and program management distributed across 30\+ countries.
The Principal, Talent Management Business Partner (TMBP) role will build a holistic, integrated talent strategy for certain business leaders within the Amazon Devices business, alongside their TMBP peers, while rolling up their sleeves to deliver and own end\-to\-end organization wide org effectiveness solutions. The Principal will conduct organization level analyses to uncover meaningful insights on critical talent issues. They will partner closely with PXT (HR) leaders and business leaders to drive organizational design efforts, and build/manage talent experiences and mechanisms, while also connecting intentionally with other Devices PXT COEs, Amazon Global Talent Management teams, and other Talent Management experts to continuously scale solutions, learn from other ongoing or new efforts, and strengthen skillsets and expertise.
This is a great opportunity for a strong systems thinker and builder to directly impact mechanisms we use to assess, grow, retain, and place Amazon Devices talent. This position provides invaluable exposure to broad HR strategic efforts where you can strongly influence. As a senior member of talent management, this role provides ample opportunity to design and innovate solutions for, and regularly communicate with, HR and business leadership.
The ideal candidate must be self\-driven, possess a high degree of ownership and have strong people and business acumen, excellent business writing and influencing skills, refined planning/project management skills, and should thrive working in a fast\-paced and ambiguous environment. This role requires dealing with a high level of autonomy and feeling comfortable organizing and operating in a space with little direction for solving hard, complex talent and business problems. There is no opportunity in this role to outsource work to external consultants, so candidates must have strong ownership, grit, and drive for results.
The successful candidate will have a demonstrated track record of:
• Knowing Your Customers. Understand their priorities, what they are saying, and more importantly, what they aren’t. Deliver and drive value for them.
• Innovation. Appreciate what exists, identify why it works. Then rebuild it or build something different that derives even MORE value and a better customer experience.
• Judgment. Take different perspectives and business needs, develop a solution that works, move the ball forward. Be able to support your opinions with sound reasoning grounded in the business.
• Systems Thinker. Understand all the connections and integration points through the entire talent management lifecycle.
• Thinking Big. How do we build it bigger, better, faster? What aren’t we thinking of?
• Research driven. We form hypotheses about the best talent management techniques and then set out to prove or disprove them with experiments and careful data collection. 
• Prioritization. There will be a constant flow of work, both tactical and strategic. Determine what gets done first and why, while managing a plan for what to do with everything else.
• Building relationships. Partner with Devices HR COE teams, HR Business Partners, Business Leaders, and corporate COE teams. Share best practices, partner on solutions, and move the organizations forward together.
• Consulting. Utilize past experience, deep knowledge of processes and policies, and knowing what’s going on across our organization to create custom solutions and localize as needed.
• Communicating. Share your ideas, listen to others, follow\-up, and follow\-up again. Clarify that your solution will solve the business problem, and use the language of the business and avoid “consultant speak”.
• Resourcefulness. If you don’t know it, that’s ok. But you should know where to go for the answer or how to find out.
• Bias for Action and dealing with ambiguity. Sometimes it is not clear how we are going to get there. Can you help carve a path? How fast can you do it? What are the tradeoffs? Take risks and be willing to try new things, fail fast and iterate.
Key job responsibilities
• Design the overall talent review strategy in partnership with the PXT (HR) and business leader, including promotions, succession planning, talent development, long\-term talent planning, and organizational reviews; design a holistic system for talent programs that deliver meaningful insight on critical talent issues and builds a strong and diverse senior leader bench and pipeline; this includes clear inputs, simplified processes, and actionable outcomes, feeding one talent process to another throughout the year. 
• Talent Management, Assessment, and Review: Build innovative, scalable talent assessment and review mechanisms to grow and retain critical senior leader talent, including proposals for new programs like rotating senior leader talent in to hard\-to\-fill and/or critical roles. 
• Recognize where there may be gaps between global and business\-specific needs. Creatively find solutions to fill these gaps, where appropriate. Influence the D\&S, AADA, and global talent teams by advocating for change and sharing best practices.
• Partner with our Analytics team to automate talent reporting and building innovative tools to uncover talent insights and drive strategic talent discussions.

You have super powers. Use them for good. We catch bad guys and stop online fraud. It’s fun. It’s hard. It matters. We need you.
Amazon’s Financial Fraud team is engaged in a technological arms race: cyber\-criminals from across the world continually look for new ways to steal from us and cover their tracks, while we invent new techniques to detect and neutralize them with ever increasing speed and scale.
It’s fun. We don’t just catch the bad guys; we stop crimes before they happen. Remember the ""Minority Report""? It’s just like that. Basically, we predict the future by developing and applying cutting\-edge machine learning systems to detect, predict, and prevent online fraud before it happens.
It’s hard. This is Amazon, so of course our services are low latency, high throughput, highly scalable, and failure proof. Our fraud prevention systems are also highly reactive: we process multiple terabytes of data yet notice changes in individual behavior patterns in seconds. Even by Amazon standards, our datasets are massive and our transaction rates impressive, and everything is built with a scrupulous attention to security.
It matters. Amazon is one of the world’s most trusted companies. Consider the implications of losing that trust. Third\-party sellers account for nearly half the items purchased on Amazon. This nearly always goes smoothly; but when sellers cheat buyers, everyone loses. Even after we refund their money, buyers are less likely to shop at Amazon in the future. Legitimate sellers lose potential sales and are less likely to sell on Amazon. And of course, the money Amazon pays in refunds and chargebacks goes straight to our bottom line and ultimately results in higher prices for all our customers.
We are looking for a passionate and innovative Software Development Engineer to join a brand new small, agile team of engineers who love solving hard problems focused on detecting and stopping bad actors.
Amazon is one of the world’s most trusted companies. Help us keep it that way.
About the team
Here at Selling Partner Services, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have 14 employee\-led affinity groups, reaching 10,000\+ employees in chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our DEI Ambassador Program. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 16 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

You have super powers. Use them for good. We catch bad guys and stop online fraud. It’s fun. It’s hard. It matters. We need you.
Amazon’s Financial Fraud team is engaged in a technological arms race: cyber\-criminals from across the world continually look for new ways to steal from us and cover their tracks, while we invent new techniques to detect and neutralize them with ever increasing speed and scale.
It’s fun. We don’t just catch the bad guys; we stop crimes before they happen. Remember the ""Minority Report""? It’s just like that. Basically, we predict the future by developing and applying cutting\-edge machine learning systems to detect, predict, and prevent online fraud before it happens.
It’s hard. This is Amazon, so of course our services are low latency, high throughput, highly scalable, and failure proof. Our fraud prevention systems are also highly reactive: we process multiple terabytes of data yet notice changes in individual behavior patterns in seconds. Even by Amazon standards, our datasets are massive and our transaction rates impressive, and everything is built with a scrupulous attention to security.
It matters. Amazon is one of the world’s most trusted companies. Consider the implications of losing that trust. Third\-party sellers account for nearly half the items purchased on Amazon. This nearly always goes smoothly; but when sellers cheat buyers, everyone loses. Even after we refund their money, buyers are less likely to shop at Amazon in the future. Legitimate sellers lose potential sales and are less likely to sell on Amazon. And of course, the money Amazon pays in refunds and chargebacks goes straight to our bottom line and ultimately results in higher prices for all our customers.
We are looking for a passionate and innovative Software Development Engineer to join a brand new small, agile team of engineers who love solving hard problems focused on detecting and stopping bad actors.
Amazon is one of the world’s most trusted companies. Help us keep it that way.

Are you interested in helping AWS deliver ever\-stronger durability, availability and disaster recovery, performance, scalability, and cost effectiveness for our customers? Are you excited by the prospect of partnering with a vast array of AWS service teams, identifying opportunities to improve their products on these dimensions, and leading technical product definition and execution to deliver on these opportunities? Would you enjoy working with a technically deep, senior engineering team on distributed systems innovation in areas such as consensus protocols and storage? If so, this might be the role for you.
Journal is a foundational AWS service that vends and manages commit logs for a number of AWS services – from databases to storage systems to compute services and beyond. These services typically use Journal on the critical path: every write or resource creation is first written to a Journal commit log. To support this, Journal is purpose\-built to provide high durability (10\+ 9s), high availability (99\.999%), high scale (100MM writes per second and growing), low latency (microseconds matter), and cost effectiveness (cents per TiB matter).
While Journal plays a significant role across AWS today, we need to define and deliver the right forward\-looking product improvements so we can keep raising the bar in what we as AWS offer to our customers. We are looking for the right Product Management leader to helm this effort, leading Journal’s customer engagement, product strategy, feature definition, and roadmap. The successful candidate will have a track record of formulating technical product direction and delivering on it, from guiding star vision to 3\-year\-plan to detail at the API and SLA level. They will have the technical aptitude required to partner effectively with senior technologists. They will have experience driving success across a diversity of customers, including building relationships, identifying needs, and partnering on engagements.
If this sounds up your alley, we’d love to hear from you.
Key job responsibilities
The primary responsibility of the Principal Product Manager \- Technical (Principal PMT\-ES) role is to own and drive the Transactional Services area forward. You will achieve this by owning the product vision, creating the product strategy, defining the customer experience, and identifying business opportunities. You own the product lifecycle including the product roadmap and feature prioritization. You are expected to contribute to engineering discussions that dive deeply into how a product solution or experience is designed and constructed. As the product manager in a deeply technical area, are expected to have deep full\-stack technical knowledge and apply this knowledge to make sure service quality, performance, and elasticity of the service will scale with the customer. You also work backwards from customers and collaborate with stakeholders to achieve the best outcomes for customer experience, adoption, and operational excellence while managing and optimizing for cost. You will provide clarity where there is ambiguity. You are a builder and, most importantly, you are customer\-obsessed.
Come build with us.
If you are interested, reach out to the hiring manager
https://www.linkedin.com/in/panghalvikas/
A day in the life
Given the scope and high level of ownership that a product manager has on the Transactional Services team, rarely are two days the same. You are a business owner, customer\-facing representative for the service, and point of contact for partner teams. On a weekly basis, you will be working with customers to learn about the problems they are trying to solve, analyzing service and business metrics, writing PRFAQs and pricing narratives, iterating on product decisions with the engineering team, thinking big to envision what's next, and demonstrating curiosity about different technologies, growth strategies, and industry trends.
On a daily basis, you will have a chance to work with everyone who makes products at AWS successful, including senior leadership, engineers, data scientists, content writers, and more. You will meet with customers to understand our core strengths and weaknesses. You will synthesize that feedback and other industry knowledge, with business and service data, to create strategies and test hypotheses. As someone central to the success of Transactional Services, people will look to you on a regular basis to solve problems and connect them with specialists. To develop that expertise, you will constantly be looking to learn by reaching out to other experts within the company and in the larger tech community, using your own product by developing samples, demos, and side\-projects, and engaging in mentorship opportunities. Our customers are developers and technical decision makers, so you will be using code, technical documentation, and architecture diagrams to understand problems and communicate solutions.

Amazon Supply Chain Services (ASCS) is the umbrella name for Amazon’s suite of services that help businesses transport, warehouse, fulfill, deliver, and plan their movement of goods, inclusive of both on\- and off\-Amazon volume. With ASCS, businesses can offload their full supply chain planning \& execution or they can choose to integrate an à la carte menu of composable supply chain primitives into their existing processes. For many years, these services have been used by Amazon sellers as standalone solutions and have played a central role in improving the Amazon CX and reducing our CTS. In 2024, we began accelerating both the externalization of these services, so that merchants can use them for their off\-Amazon channels, as well as the interoperability of these services, which enables merchants to easily use more than one service at a time. Our three largest ASCS services that service off\-Amazon volume are Multi\-Channel Fulfillment (using inventory in Amazon’s fulfillment network to ship orders from non\-Amazon channels), Amazon Freight (bulk shipments from/to 1P and 3P warehouses) and Amazon Shipping (parcel shipments from/to 1P and 3P warehouses).
The ASCS FP\&A and Automation Finance Manager will own the consolidation of the financials for the 8 ASCS services. This role will partner with each service’s finance team and business leaders to build a single financial narrative for our ASCS business to be presented to STeam and BOD. This role will also partner with each service finance team and with other central finance teams (such as Ops Central Finance, Product teams and IPAT) to standardize and automate the 8 ASCS P\&Ls.
This leader will also own the automation roadmap for the Externalized Fulfillment services within ASCS (Multi\-channel fulfillment/MCF and Buy with Prime/BwP) with the objective of eliminating manual inputs. This leader will be the main MCF/BwP Finance POC to the Data Analytics team and define the data and reports required by Finance from this team.
We are looking for finance leaders who are passionate about building new businesses, FP\&A and automation.
Key job responsibilities
\- ASCS financials consolidation and reporting including quarterly guidance, monthly and quarterly business reviews, Steam and BOD.
